Next iteration of my system to display my [wiki][wiki], as rendered by [Next.js][nextjs] and [uniorg][uniorg]'s parsing capabilities.

Note: Maintenance is on hiatus while I work on a new programming system.

Note to self: Had `rescript-nextjs-template/` cloned locally to work on this. Unclear whether `rescript` is even worth investing in; the best strongly typed system to work on, I think, is probably `scala.js`; `Clojurescript` is so concise and well done, though, that it doesn't _really_ need maintenance to work well (despite the lack of types).
